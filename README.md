# 🚀 Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard  

As part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**, I built my first **Power BI dashboard** to analyze and visualize sales performance.  
This project highlights **data preparation, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design**.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview  

The dashboard provides insights into:  
- **Sales by Region, Product, Category, Channel, and Sales Rep**  
- **Monthly & Yearly trends with Target comparisons**  
- **Variance analysis for regional performance**  
- **MTD (Month-to-Date), YTD (Year-to-Date), and YoY (Year-over-Year) comparisons**  

### ✨ Unique Features  
- **Home Page Navigation** → directs to other pages for smooth user experience  
- **Drill-through Page** → deeper analysis of specific data points  
- **Dynamic Toggle** → switch between **Volume** and **Revenue** in a single dashboard

## ⚙️ Data Preparation  
- Cleaned and transformed Excel data using **Power Query**  
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized naming  
- Ensured accurate date formatting for **Time Intelligence functions**

## 🛠️ Data Modeling  
- Designed a **Star Schema** with:  
  - **Fact Table:** Sales  
  - **Dimension Tables:** Date, Region, Product, Channel, Sales Rep  
- Created relationships to enable accurate filtering and drill-down

## 📐 DAX & Analysis  
- Built custom measures for:  
  - **Sales vs. Target**  
  - **Variance %**  
  - **MTD, YTD, YoY comparisons**  
  - **Revenue and Volume KPIs**
